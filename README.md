# Hybrid DEX Smart Contract

## Overview
This Hybrid DEX Smart Contract is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) that integrates the order book model with the Raydium aggregator to provide optimal trade execution on Solana. 
It enables traders to benefit from deep liquidity, fast order matching, and efficient routing for the best prices.

## Key Features
- Hybrid Trading Model: Combines the order book with an automated market maker (AMM) via the Raydium aggregator.
- Best Execution: Routes orders through the order book and Raydium to achieve the most favorable price.
- High-Speed Transactions: Built on Solana, ensuring ultra-fast settlement with minimal fees.
- On-Chain Order Book: Provides transparent, decentralized, and permissionless trading.
- Liquidity Optimization: Aggregates liquidity from both order book and Raydium’s AMM pools.
- Composable & Modular: Easily integrates with other Solana-based DeFi applications.

## How It Works
- User Places an Order: Users can place limit or market orders on the on-chain order book.
- Order Matching: The smart contract matches orders internally or routes them to Raydium’s liquidity pools for optimal execution.
- Trade Execution: The best available price is executed instantly with minimal slippage.
- Settlement - Transactions are settled on-chain in a decentralized manner.
